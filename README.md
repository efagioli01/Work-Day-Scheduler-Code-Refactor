# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## My Task

For the fifth homework assignment in week five of UNH Full-Stack Coding BootcampCreate I modified starter code to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. 

## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Description

When the user opens the planner the current day and time is displayed at the top of the page. The user is then presented with time-blocks with standard business hours 9am - 5pm, an hour in each row. The time-blocks are color coded, grey for past, green for present, and red for future events. The user is able to click into the text area, write their task for the hour and click the save button to save their task to the page and to local storage.
